/*1.ExecutorService executorService=Executor.newCachedThreadPool();
  - going to return an executorService  that can dynamically reuse threads
  before starting a job= it going to check whether there are any threads that finished the 
  job.. reuse them
  - if there are no waiting threads - it is going to create another one
  - good for the processor... effective solution!!!
  
  2.ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(N);
  -maximaze the number of threads
  - if we want to start a job- if all the threads are busy we have to wait for one to 
    terminate
   3. ExecutorService executorService= Executor.newSingleThreadExecutor();
   it uses a single thread for the job
    execute()->runnable + callable
    submit()->runnable
