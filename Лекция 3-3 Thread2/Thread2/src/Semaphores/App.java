/*Most of the executor implementations in java.util.concurrent use thread pools,
   which consist of worker threads. This kind of thread exists separately 
   from the Runnable and Callable tasks it executes and is often used to
    execute multiple tasks.
    One common type of thread pool is the fixed thread pool. This type of pool
    always has a specified number of threads running; if a thread is somehow
    terminated while it is still in use, it is automatically replaced with a
     new thread
